The folder Figure1 ----> provides the data and code to produce the
                         figures in Fig.1.
The folder Figure2 ----> provides the data and code to produce the 
                         figures in Fig.2, and SI Figs. 2, 3 and 4.
The folder Figure3 ----> provides the data and code to produce the 
                         figures in Fig.3.
The folder Figure4 ----> provides the data and code to produce the 
                         SI Fig. 6.

About simulation code : NuRsEv2.0 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The folder Simulation_real ----> provides simulation code to study the 
                  resilience on real networks, in this folder there are 
                  three folders corresponding to three dynamics studied 
                  in our paper.

The folder Simulation_synthetic ----> provides simulation code to study 
                  the resilience on synthetic networks.
